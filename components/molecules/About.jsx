            I've been working previously as an inspector in Dubai Municipality &
            believe me, that was so fun to continue living with. However, I've
            been also having an undescribable & unjustifiable passion towards IT
            & programming at the same time!

          <p>
            A twist happened led us, <a href="/"> Dua</a> (my lovely wife) & I
            to the Netherlands as refugees
          </p>

          <p>
            Thankfully in 2018, we've enrolled ourselves in a coding school
            <a href="/">HYF</a> & we've graduated afterwards in 2019 to start
            our journeys as an IT family üòÅ
